# VirtualArtGallery2

The Virtual Art Gallery is a portfolio project made with the combined efforts of Elliott Wilkinson & Jessy Kinsman to continue developing the fullstack skills they learned through Tech Elevator's 30 week part time program.  It currently uses a combination of Java & SQL to create a server and database to house users and their artwork, though they plan on implementing Javascript as well as HTML & CSS to have a client side that will host a webpage.
